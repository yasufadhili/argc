It compiles to x86_64 assembly and runs on Linux, offering a modular approach to programming. What is Argon? Argon is a playful experiment in programming language design. It allows developers to explore compiler construction, assembly, and language design concepts. While not production-ready, it serves as a great learning tool for students, hobbyists, and anyone curious about how programming languages work. Current Status Argon is in its early stages of development and is not intended for production use. It lacks advanced optimisations, has a minimal standard library, and is primarily a tool for experimentation and education. Features Modular Programming : Support for linking with C and C++ static libraries. Lightweight Standard Library : A small set of utilities to get started. Educational Compiler : Written in C++ with minimal optimisations to keep the codebase approachable. Online Playground : Experiment with Argon code directly in your browser.
