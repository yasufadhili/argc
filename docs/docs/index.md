# The Argon Language Documentation

Argon is a toy programming language designed for learning and experimentation. It compiles to x86_64 assembly and runs on Linux, offering a modular approach to programming.

## What is Argon?

Argon is a playful experiment in programming language design. It allows developers to explore compiler construction, assembly, and language design concepts. While not production-ready, it serves as a great learning tool for students, hobbyists, and anyone curious about how programming languages work.

### Current Status

Argon is in its early stages of development and is not intended for production use. It lacks advanced optimisations, has a minimal standard library, and is primarily a tool for experimentation and education.

## Features

- **Modular Programming**: Support for linking with C and C++ static libraries.
- **Lightweight Standard Library**: A small set of utilities to get started.
- **Educational Compiler**: Written in C++ with minimal optimisations to keep the codebase approachable.
- **Online Playground**: Experiment with Argon code directly in your browser.
