# 📜 Argon Language Specification

Welcome to the **Argon Language Specification** directory! This is where the magic happens (or at least where I pretend it does). If you're the kind of person who enjoys diving into the nitty-gritty details of how a programming language works, you're in the right place (Aktually, Wrong Place).

## 📂 What’s Inside?

This directory contains all the formal documentation and specifications for the Argon programming language. Here’s a quick overview of what you’ll find:

- **`syntax.md`**: A detailed breakdown of Argon’s syntax, including keywords, operators, and grammar rules.  

- **`semantics.md`**: The rules and behaviour of Argon’s constructs, including type systems, scoping, and memory management.  
- **`modules.md`**: How Argon handles modularity, imports, and linking.  
- **`examples/`**: A collection of annotated example programs to demonstrate various language features.  
- **`roadmap.md`**: A wishlist of features and improvements for future versions of Argon (because dreaming is free).  

## 🛠️ How to Use This Directory

1. **Learn the Language**: Start with `syntax.md` to understand the building blocks of Argon.  
   
2. **Understand the Behaviour**: Dive into `semantics.md` to see how Argon handles execution.  
3. **Explore Examples**: Check out the `examples/` folder for real-world use cases (or as close to "real-world" as a toy language gets).  
4. **Contribute**: If you spot inconsistencies or have ideas for improvement, feel free to contribute!  

## 🌟 Highlights of the Argon Spec

- **Non-Standard Syntax**: Argon’s syntax is not unique (and occasionally quirky).  
  
- **Modular Design**: Modules are first-class citizens in Argon, making it easy to organise and reuse code.  
  
- **x86_64 Assembly Output**: Argon compiles directly to assembly, giving you a peek under the hood.
